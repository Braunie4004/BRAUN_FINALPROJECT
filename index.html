        <h1>Artificial Intelligence: Strength and Limitations</h1>
        <h3>By, Sophia Braun</h3>

        <h2>The Everyday Impact of A.I.</h2> 

        <p>Since the development and introduction of artificial intelligence (A.I.), it has become second nature for many individuals to turn to servers like ChatGPT and Gemini for answers to their questions. These platforms are captivating users by generating unique responses to the provided prompts. A.I. can serve as a fact-checker and sense of security to assist in finding human errors in work, and it can serve as a threat to jobs for many in the professional world. It is important to explore the reality that A.I. has its imperfections along with its abilities.</p>
        
        <h2>Professional Use: A.I. in the Buisness World</h2>

        <p>Josh Schiffman is the CEO of Aureclar. His company develops products including “Executive A.I.” for professional board members and business leaders to assist them in making business decisions faster and provide comprehension and context to their governance decisions. Through his work both developing and analyzing the challenges with A.I. in the professional world, he said that current A.I. agents, the tools that read and understand what a user is asking, are still being developed due to their imperfections. </p>
      
        <h2>Guardrails and the Role of Developers</h2>
        <p>While Schiffman mostly works with an A.I. software known as Cursor when building his business-based A.I. tools, he says that developers need to continually work to introduce guardrails and updated limitations for the A.I. to follow to ensure that it is functioning properly. These guardrails are a series of specific instructions to make sure that the A.I. is able to justify all of the decisions that it is making based on the instructions provided by the developer.</p>
        <p>Even while A.I. developers like Schiffman regularly update their guardrails to best fit the needs of future clients and to ensure the A.I.’s accuracy, there are still imperfections. During one of Schiffman’s recent risk assessments for the A.I. he is developing, he observed A.I. claiming that some of his inputted content was wrong, though it had no reason to make that call.</p>

        <h2>Detecting Errors Through Trial and Error</h2>
        <p>To prevent similar mistakes and A.I.'s attempt to think for itself, trial and error is Schiffman’s go-to response. By using multiple A.I. platforms or streams within the same platform, A.I. can help search for its own mistakes within the platform.</p>
        <p>This research is extremely important for detecting accuracy and biases in all A.I. platforms. Research done by the Columbia Journalism Review and entitled, “A.I. Search Has a Citation Problem,” highlights just one of the areas where A.I. has a lot of work to do in order to improve its accuracy.</p>
        <p>The data presented by Aisvarya Chandrasekar, Dhrumil Mehta, Kaylee Williams, and Sarah Grevy concluded that often, A.I. is incorrect when it comes to factually answering questions that require source information.</p>

                    "use strict";
                    window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){
                        if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){
                            var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");
                            for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                                for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)
                                    if(r.contentWindow===a.source){
                                        var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";
                                        r.style.height=d
                                    }
                        }
                    }))
                }();
            </script>
        </div>
        <h2>Users May Not Notice Inaccuracy</h2>
        <p>When looking at these situations with A.I. from a user perspective, the user might not know that the source information for the question that they asked is incorrect. Through a series of tests with A.I. and a series of prompts, it was clear that answers, established as “known” by humans running the tests, did not match the generated responses.</p>

        <p>Without the necessary guardrails in place, A.I. may attempt to make decisions on its own. But it is important to remember that this is why A.I. developers exist: to continually make the necessary revisions and updates to the coding and development of these platforms so that the servers run according to the developer’s design.</p>

                    window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){
                        if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){
                            var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");
                            for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                                for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)
                                    if(r.contentWindow===a.source){
                                        var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";
                                        r.style.height=d
                                    }
                        }
                    }))
                }();
            </script>
        </div>
        <h2>The Question of Jobs</h2>

        <p>This all leads to the overarching question of many current A.I. users and working professionals of today’s world: Will A.I. come for people’s jobs? The answer is complex. While A.I. platforms still get tired of storing older instructions in some cases and continue to have imperfections, professionals like Schiffman say that while A.I. will take over the responsibilities of some existing jobs, it is not time to panic.</p>

        
        <h2>The Importance of Critical Use</h2>

        <p>In addition to taking on the responsibility to adapt to the development of A.I., it is still extremely important to be critical of the responses that these platforms are generating. There are no A.I. developer credentials that are required to check individual uses of A.I. for biases and accuracy.
</p>
<p>While the future of A.I. technology is still in the works, it is important to seek out ways to fact-check the information that these sources are providing and not take the content of their responses at face value. Both A.I. developers and users are responsible for minimizing biases and fact errors. For many, using A.I. is stepping into uncharted territory for the future of technology, but these tools are just tools in their current form and require human analysis to improve.</p>
